# Solar Irradiance
Solar Irradiance is the output of light energy from the sun that reaches the earth. It is  measured in term of amount of sunlight that hits a square meter of a surface in one second.

The terms irradiance, irradiation and radiance are often used interchangeably.  

Radiation - Number of photons emitted by a single source.

Irradiation - The radiation falling on a surface

# How to measure irradiance
Irradiance can be measured and calculated using four components: GHI, BHI, DHI and DNI.

HI represents Horisontal Irradiance, referring to the fact that irradiance is received by a horizontal surface with 0 deg tilt relative to the surface of the spherical earth.

G stands for Globla, B stands for Beam and D stands for Diffuse.

GHI refers to Global Horizontal Irradiance which is the total irradiance from the sun on a horizontal surface on the spherical earth. 

BHI refers to Beam Horizontal Irradiance is the direct irradiance from the sun. The irradiance that also causes shadows. 

DHI refers to Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance which is the component of the irradiance that is scattered in the atmosphere and therefore has no clear direction.

DNI refers to Direct normal irradiance

GHI is calculated from:

GHI = DHI + BHI

where
	
BHI = (DNI * cos(z))

hence

GHI = DHI + (DNI * cos(z))
